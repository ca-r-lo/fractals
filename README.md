# Fractals
A fractal is a complex geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity at various scales, meaning that the same patterns repeat at different levels of magnification. These intricate structures often arise from simple mathematical equations through iterative processes. Fractals can be found in nature, art, and various scientific fields, illustrating the beauty of mathematical patterns and their ability to capture the complexity of the world around us.

These are the examples of fractals

Mandelbrot Set: One of the most famous fractals, the Mandelbrot Set, is generated by iterating a simple mathematical formula. It reveals a stunningly intricate and infinitely complex pattern with self-similar details at every level of zoom.
