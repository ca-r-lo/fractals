# Fractals
A fractal is a complex geometric shape that exhibits self-similarity at various scales, meaning that the same patterns repeat at different levels of magnification. These intricate structures often arise from simple mathematical equations through iterative processes. Fractals can be found in nature, art, and various scientific fields, illustrating the beauty of mathematical patterns and their ability to capture the complexity of the world around us.

These are the examples of fractals
Mandelbrot Set: One of the most famous fractals, the Mandelbrot Set, is generated by iterating a simple mathematical formula. It reveals a stunningly intricate and infinitely complex pattern with self-similar details at every level of zoom.

***Sierpinski Triangle***: Created through a recursive process of removing triangles from a larger triangle, the Sierpinski Triangle is a classic fractal that showcases self-replication and is often employed in mathematics education to illustrate the concept of recursion.

***Koch Snowflake***: Formed by iteratively adding triangles to the sides of an equilateral triangle, the Koch Snowflake is a self-replicating fractal that progressively increases its perimeter while maintaining a finite area, highlighting the paradoxical nature of some fractal geometries.

***Julia Set***: Similar to the Mandelbrot Set, the Julia Set is generated through iterative calculations based on complex numbers. It produces captivating patterns with intricate details and diverse shapes, showcasing the richness and diversity achievable through different mathematical formulations.

***Dragon Curve***: Generated by repeatedly replacing line segments with a specific geometric pattern, the Dragon Curve is a fractal that exhibits self-similarity. It is known for its fascinating winding structure and has applications in computer graphics and data compression algorithms.

These examples represent just a fraction of the diverse and captivating fractal patterns that emerge from simple mathematical processes, demonstrating the beauty of complexity arising from seemingly basic equations.
